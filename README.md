# Maipulator
Robot manipulators are created from a sequence of link and joint combinations. The links are the rigid members connecting the joints.
the project includes:
* Forward Kinematics
* Inverse kinematics

## Forward Kinematics
Forward Kinematics deals with the joints positions to determine the end effector position. It is calculated using tranformation matrix derived from DH parameters of the robot. 
## Inverse Kinematics
Inverse Kinematics determines the joints position for the end effector to reach a desired position.
